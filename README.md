# 3Button-Calculator
My new Embedded Systems project is designing a 3-button basic calculator using Atmega32 microcontroller.


Operation:-

We have designed a calculator with three buttons: 'Up,' 'Down,' and 'Enter.' 

The 'Up' button increments the current number, while the 'Down' button decrements it, and the 'Enter' button shifts the cursor to the next spot. 

If the cursor lands on the equal sign, it displays the result.


Features:-

-You can do basic mathematical operations ( + , - , * , / ) between two integer number.

-Handle math error (Dividing by zero).

-Handle floating results at dividing operation.



Hardware Components:-
1. LCD 

2. Switches


Software Layers:-

1- MCAL => DIO

2- HAL => LCD(4 Bit Mode).
